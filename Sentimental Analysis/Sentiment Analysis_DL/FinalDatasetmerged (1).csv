DELETING THIS APP!! Nykaa sucks!! today is 30th october and in Nykaa customer service one lady lied to me that they tried to contact me and the other lady lied to me that my package is on still in BLUE DART courier due to any natural disaster.. lol natural disaster is occuring only in their office!!,-1

This shows they don't have any product in the store and are just trying to get the order first and then you wait for your order.  Highly advisable to those who want the product in the year 2050:-),-1

"I have been associated with Nykaa from last 1 and half year, since then I haven't shopped from cosmetic store or any other website. But its unfortunate that I didn't got any reward for my commitment with the company. I placed an order of 9000 rupees two days and when I told the company to deliver the package to my home address instead of office they didn't agreed on this. Infact I am not sure whether i will get my refund or order. Never buying again anything from Nykaa.",-1

I bought two dress from Nykaa. When I bought both were in stock but they didn't confirm one of the purchase. I did inquiry they said product is out of stock once it will be in stock we will deliver. After one week they cancelled my order but I didn't get refund after given timeline. Now they are saying check with bank in chat support. Bank has not received any money from their end. I will not prefer Nykaa for anything. Usual order process is super slow. Customer support is worst.,-1

"This is really a pathetic app I have ever used to shop online. They guys don't keep their promise. At the time of order we recieve different delivery date, different date showing in orders options in app, different delivery date when we try to track the order. Also, customer care team says that date will be decided by logistic team. So that means we should not believe on any message or estimated delivery promise by nykaa guys. They don't care about their customers. Highly unsatisfactory response.",-1

I ordered a loreal mascara which was preused as there were small hair on the wand. So for the next time delivery of the body shop deep conditioner tub i asked them to send sealed pack product.

Tho most worth less service I have ever seen. First of all they will not deliver your item saying that consignee was not available at home then when you call the customer support team they will only say we have raised your concern and the team will take care of it and you will get your item as soon as possible. After that they will resolved the ticket without helping you. Even the third party courier will not answer your phone call. Just worthless so will suggest to you think twice before invest your money in nykaa.,-1

I was very happy with Nykaa but their delivery service is getting worst and worst. I received  part of my order and don't know what happened with other part. One order was never delivered. Sad is the site doesn't show any estimated delivery day! They will come anyway at your door without any prior information and if you're not home they will not send it again. Agents will call you and say that it will be rescheduled but it never does! If you call the customer service they will ask you to place an fresh order. What's the point of 'sale' then? If I have to place a fresh order with higher price?! I don't think I will order from Nyssa ever again. Don't know what will happen with the other orders I placed recently!,-1

"Experience of First purchase at Nykaa was very bad. Ordered a nose trimmer. 
After delivery, when i checked the item, i found it useless as it was not 
working properly. When i called Nykaa care, its representative denied to 
exchange or refund the item despite half hour discussion also she didn't 
provided any alternative for the same at Nykaa side. Now Nykaa has advised 
me to contact the brand but they are still not providing a refund or 
replacement for the product that is not working properly from very first 
day after receiving the product from nykaa. I am still unaware about the 
policy of Nykaa who are selling defective electronics products with no 
refund or replacement by Nykaa. Nykaa is only fooling its customers. Very 
bad policy and will never purchase again at NYKAA",-1

"The products in the app are not updated hence, if you place an order for a product, you would have to wait endless days and weeks. If you contact support through chat, the Chat Bot is clueless of what to update hence, you end up chatting with someone. Nykaa doesn't have the products and have the courage to send spam emails everyday. Just like other eCommerce sites, what's stopping you from updating your infrastructure? It's high time, Nykaa stops hiding behind the pandemic situation.",-1

"I had worst experience with nykaa. I ordered few products during clearance sale, majority of them were defective. Worst part is 2 of them are dry, 1 lipstick and 1 maskara. You guys are only clearing your stock without thinking about customers.

Moreover, how you decide if product is dried from a picture, it's not a garment. Never going to use nykaa again",-1

Had to cancel my order because I knew after 6 more working days they would again have the same response. Highly highly pathetic service.

Very late delivery. They can't even confirm when they can deliver nor cancle the order. It's been 12days that I ordered. That too for Hyderabad location. I don't have minus option to rate you people or else I would have rated you that. It's been 15 days now still didn't get my delivery. And even no cancle option. Customer care can't tell exact date of delivery or how many days it will take more..... disgusting service every. When your 3 party delivery is too late change them.,-1

And after successful payment, no order number was generated and no confirmation received by me. Have complained to nykaa many times , but no satisfactory response. Will have to go to consumer court .

"This app doesn't deserve single star also. their service and their logistics partners are so pathetic, horrible and jobless. I think this app Nykaa and their so called team is sitting somewhere to ensure the product never get delivered to anyone who orders through this useless app. secondly customer care executive doesn't know how to respond with customer. most worst part is, they itself couldn't track the order even after the ETA is crossed. i won't insist or recommend this app to anyone.",-1

"There's so many issues in delivery process.. they dont provide delivery guy no. so tht we can plan for our day.. moreover they dont give accurate details for delivery.. delivery can come anytym they even dont notify about delivery day... Jst for ths reason m giving them 2 stars.. you should improve ths.. and after reading payment review tht someone's credit detail was hack,m afraid of doing onln payments..plz do smthng about it... I doubt about the product reviews becoz it need aprovl omg.. sometimes i feel tht gud reviews are sponsored here.. i ordered a lip cryon and tht was hollow from backside and the mascara was dried one... av kis p believe kre... are you guys sitting there to cheat us... I was thinking nykaa is mainly for cosmetics and you would not do these things lyk Amazon but now i feel no,Amazon was much btr..",-1

I used to love this app and also i have purchased many products but the return and refund policy and replacement of the product is suck. The customer service is very unsatisfying. They say they will get back to you but they don't. Don't even get refund and your money will be wasted.,-1
user friendly thanks,2
I tried to order during the Balck Friday sale and the amount was debited from my account but the order was not placed. I tried contacting the customer care and they said it would be refunded in 2 days which wasn't. The amount has not been refunded to my account inspite calls and mails there is no proper response. Worst service by the team. Got reply from your team but still haven't got the refund.. I sent mail back and no response. Never ever purchase from nykaa. They just get the money from you and not deliver the product or refund the money.,-1

"Can't trust this app and its poor customer service ever. As of my experience customer service is the poorest . I'm saying this bcz of my recent experience that they shipped me a wrong size product and didn't take responsibility of any and at the end they can't even resolve this issue except saying that ""sorry mam"" again and again. And I lost my money for that poor order. So if in case eventually you will get a damaged or wrong product there is no one to short it out.",-1

they are refunding it to nykaa wallet which means i can use that money to 
buy another nykaa products only. I must say very cunning tactic. Stop 
fooling customers. There was another incidence where nykaa updated me that 
they have delivered my prepaid order, i had to call them many times to

"Disappointed with Nykaa return policy. I have placed an order and as soon as I received it, I checked all the products. When found not appropriate according to product description I immediately put down the return request. It has been more than a week the product is still lying with me with no update. When I call customer care all they say we will forward your concern to revelent dept but don't take any action. Will never shop from Nykaa again.  Highly disappointed. Wouldnt recommend to anyone.",-1

A similar email was sent again. But there was no reply either. Finally I sent a feedback and then finally got a response that there is some rare delay. And they will try their best to dispatch products in next 3-4 days. I finally got my product just now after 10 days.  Avoid for you own piece of mind.,-1

Not accepted from Brand like Nykaa, it's very disappointing.",-1

using nykaa for last 2years and for the first time using prepaid option instead of cash n delivery and for the products I paid for earlier They are not sending to me because address related issue..

U place an order with 2 items. Nykaa provide you with an estimated date of delivery. Till the last date of the estimation as provided no communication from Nykka side. After I call I am informed one of the two products I ordered is out of stock. And the other time will delievrd to me ASAP. Now my question is if Nykaa knew that one item is not available why did they wait for me to call and then initiate the refund process? So does Nykaa wait for the consumer to follow up for the delivery timeline of the product?Does Nykaa own any responsibility of doing their business?,-1

I have ordered two products and without the order got confirmed the amount was debited from my account. Later they sent a msg to deliver the product for free cash on delivery and demanded cash again. I tried to contact customer care for morethan 4 days. Dey never attended the call. Always it says busy.. better they can delete the customer care number. The amount was not refunded at all. Useless app and i never recommend anyone. If u buy from this app it will be a headache. Pls dont use or buy from this..,-1

"I had ordered 9 products, out of which 1 was missing. I tried getting in touch with the customer service team but I didn't get any reply for 2 days. On the third day, I get a reply saying that they cannot help me since the delivery box had been thrown! With the coronavirus pandemic, do you'll expect me to preserve a cardboard box! I never expected such service from a brand of your repute. Will definitely warn my family and friends never to buy anything from Nykaa",-1

The first time i ordered products from Nykaa they were of amazing quality so i happily placed an order for the 2nd time but i was very disappointed to see that sadly products quality wasn't the same. I've been using Mac and other brands for a long time so i could tell the products weren't the original manufacturings. Infact I had to stop using Mac kajal and Maybelline makeup remover completely (ordered from Nykaa) as it was affecting my skin and eyes. P.S- I'll have to think order anything again.,-1

"Cheating customers!! Ordered a product for the first time and received a fake empty bottle of some haldi chandan facewash( i ordered a moisturizer). Customer care is pathetic, slow and return policies are worse. They even check your reviews before being posted online (but can't check the product before sending to their customers) and decide if they should be posted even though you are a verified customer. Never buying anything from here total wastage of money and time.",-1

really really pathetic service from Nykaa. i ordered something from there and it was not delivered. I have to chase them and the product is still not delivered. I have raised the issue with them 5 times and they are not taking the matter seriously. All they say is we have esclated the matter. Above all the deliver team of Nykaa lies that they couldn't contact us. Would advice Nykaa to change there Delivery service. Otherwise they would end up having 1000's of unstatisfied customers,-1

If i track the status it was showing the product was returned. I didn't get the product only, then how can i return. After that i called to customer care. She told the product was returned to ware house. Even they didn't sent one single message or mail. After that they told they will refund the money back. I waited for 6 days. Till now i didn't get any money from them. Bakwas app. Please don't buy the products. They will cheat you.",-1

"My sister ordered some stuff from Nykaa where Sugar brand was running an offer by giving a Rs. 999 gift along with some minimum purchase. They shipped the stuff but cancelled the shipping of free gift. After raising an inquiry, they are trying to make it up by offerring a 200 rs coupon. Seriously this kind of loot is not expected from Nykaa. This is how you guys treat your cusomers. Pathetic. This is how you do business by stealing gifts from customer's purchases and then selling them on MRP.",-1

Saying that its used and not a tester they cancelled the return request. But i didnt use it. I jus tried on my hand. Or else how ill i understand the shade? And they r telling me its not a tester.

This is a money hungry company shamelessly promoted by so called, ""influencers"" Better to use sephora instead. You will only see brand names but you will be disappointed with shade ranges and price. Bad offers and way more expensive than actual price ps they charge a lot for delivery. Sometimes they give out unsealed/close to expiration products. Worst costumer care, they don't even respond to your mail!",-1

"A big glitch in the review system is you can post all the reviews you want but the reviews get ""Approved"" by THEM (Nykaa), they can decide if your review vl get posted or not so obviously there is no 100% transparency with customers like other apps such as Amazon. Also they clearly mention that only write reviews about product and NOT abt service nd such reviews wont get approved. So, there is no way you can post a review about service or if your product was received damage due to poor delivery.",-1

The worst app ever. They don't care about general customers apart from bloggers. They even can't deliver your products within the range of expected date. I have to wait for 2 weeks to get my products whereas they promise to deliver the order at your doorstep from 1 to 4 business days. And their customer service is horrible. Every single day they promise to deliver the order by the end of that day. But they never do accordingly. Really disappointed by Nykaa.,-1

And the reply is epic-: ""Hey sometimes colors may vary as the screen saturation and brightness is different from one device to another. Of course Nykaa..

Every time delivery person calls and ask u to come to downstairs to pick-up the delivery because he want to deliver other packages also so he don't want to come to ur doorstep to deliver ur package. And if u are unable to do accordingly he will not deliver ur package as he is least interested. If we want to come outside and accept the parcel then we would go to the chemist shop and buy or products..,-1

Horrible experinece. Do not trust this app or website. They mention as returnable product but they will not provide a button to return a product once purchased. Another tactic of nykaa to con a customer. Even after u talk to customer care they will keep delaying the number of days so that the returnable period expires. Better but from Amazon with better customer service n transparent policy.,-1

Their display says something n the actual product will be a nightmare. They come up with reason as 'pixel' difference. This is not a way to handle. I was an happy customer for almost 5yrs. After facing such.. never again with nyaka.. instead I'll place order in other platforms.,-1

"Poor return policy. Customer support in India is total waste. They only respond with standard template messages like ""please wait for 24-48 hours for the update from us"".. But that 48 hours never ends... No one will respond you or ready to solve the issue. I dint expect this from nykaa. Thought they are very professional in handling returns of damaged or wrongly delivered items. But had a worst experience. My money was wasted.",-1

The date of delivery suddenly changes within hours from 10 days to next day and if you're out of station on that day and request to deliver it a day after, they just cancel it. They don't even call you before cancelling. You can't call the deliveryman or the delivery company in any way.",-1

"I ordered 20 items. Some the the products were already OPENED AND USED and some one was expired. Disgusting!! I tried raising complaint on app but it only kept processing. I sent email to them with all pictures. They replied to my email saying they cannot replace so I have to go for a refund process and asked for more pictures. After following up for many days, I got notification that my return process is started. But, When i checked in app, my return was rejected. Just like that.",-1

These days app is veeerrrrry slow. Takes forever to open a particular section or brand or anything searched for. Just that the app opens quickly then on second click it takes hell long to open.

"My first review ever after being so pissed by ""the great Nykaa"" support. I actually wanted to give a zero. It's a horrible horrible experience to buy anything from this website/app, as though you are stealing something and they won't let you. It's even more horrible to cancel something as though you are again trying to steal your own money. This website and it's support, sucks.

"Worst app. Bcz it doesn't apply the offers mentioned in the app itself n when u ask customer care about what had happened to the offer, he tells you that the stock must have been over by then n that is the reason it was not applied. Then y do u even give false offers n cheat the customers?? Another thing is it doesn't let you return the products which u do not like and return gets rejected. Bcz u have ordered,it's not a compulsion u shud like all the products as they may not be as in the image.",-1
"Very pathetic experience especially with PrePaid orders. Do not pay in advance for your orders in advance. They are mostly lost. Happened twice with me. It also doesn't provide with the delivery person's name or contact number (unlike other shopping platforms) hence if there is any issue, you are just stuck! Customer support is not at par as well, just trying to dissolve the topic with their vocal abilities. Its better to pay a tad higher on Amazon and be satisfied about the delivery process.",-1

I used to like this app a lot previously but it disappointed me this time by mandating the purchase over 1200 for a free delivery and that to during this critical most situation as we can't afford wasting money over buying other not so essential products only to have that one sanitizer for free of delivery and also the delivery charge is doubly higher than before. This is so cheap of them to be taking advantage of needy people during this pandemic.,-1

Later, i received my order and it does not fit me. So what i get response from another end that it is no returnable product. I saw the application still same policy was there and i also sent Screenshot to one of the representatives. Still he denied and afterthat they changed policies.

pathetic app. Worst order tracking. Nykaa gives huge discounts but they send expired products. After that they asks for an image and invoice against the product but unfortunately their poor servers stuck in between. Ruin my money completely by ordering products from nykaa.,-1
"Worst management ever..no any customer care no provided. For order issues there's no proper response from them Only chat you can do and after getting ticket no for complain, it's been more than 3 days still not any reply I received on that..really disappointed.",-1

"Very glitchy app.  I am surprised with the 4 star reviews here as they have not gotten same basics right! 1)For one, if you want to go back to the home page,clicking on the Nykaa icon doesn't get you there (as it would happen with any app) and you have to keep pressing the back button to get to the home page. God bless your patience if you have surfed multiple pages!! 2) My latest order isn't showing, although the amount has been debited from my account. 3) When I tried to email them through the app (I am signed in to the app), I have to fill in my name, email address all over again. What for? I am already signed in and it should be pre-fed with the option to change if needed. 4) On clicking the 'submit' button, it says 'error, try again'.   If you guys are listening, please fix these things. I am sure many have the time and patience to put up with these silly mistakes. But many also don't. Also, it would really help everyone if you guys use the app to do some shopping yourself.",-1

How is that possible if the stock is there then the products can't disappear right? So now Im not gonna order anything from this app which manipulates consumers",-1

Bad experience. The delivery dates on the site/app do not match with the actual delivery dates which is highly misleading for a customer. It's a difference of 4-5 days! Also customer care says products can be delivered on urgent basis but that's not mentioned in the app or site anywhere. Is it expected that the customer call up customer care everytime while placing order? I placed order as the delivery dayee were 12th but get a message on 12th that order is dispatched from Mumbai on 12th. I called up the customer care and they said it will take another 3-4 working days! They cant cancel as it's already dispatched and it will be cancel once returned. The pace of delivery has me thinking how long it takes to get the refund and if at all! Hugely disappointed.,-1

Worst Wow thanks to nykaa. They just deleted my review as they don't want the users to read it but I'll write it again and again. Don't order anything from nykaa as they'll promise you to provide options before you order but will give you nothing and if you'll come up with the complaint then they will give you a small refund and say sorry to you. Feelings don't matter to them only business matters to them so they just will refund for their mistake and don't think about customer who order as gift,-1

Have ordered 800 rs jewelry set. It was worse than 50 RS product. Have raised replacement/refund request as soon as I got the product. But they simply denied it by saying it's not refundable and apparently it's my mistake that I haven't seen it while ordering. It's a great way to do fraud. Well done Nykaa and team. Will never order something ever in life & will keep spreading this message. Please don't delete my review or ask me to contact me to customer support as it's useless.,-1

now I had been using Nykaa quite satisfactorily (I am a Prive member) as I 
had no issues with the products so had no need to contact the customer 
care. But in my recent pur hase i received an unsealed product. I wanted to 
return it. But didnot receive any support from Nykaa all i got was some 
ticket number and no addressal to my problems.Once their product is sold

"Nykaa had been one of the greatest apps till the last update, now the app has become too slow and i cannot open my cart, it's not loading at all. Pls fix this asap. Another bad thing that happened is that in these hard times during covid19, they have raised their minimum cart value to 1000 and shipping charges to 99 (which was earlier 500 and 49 respectively). You guys should understand that people always don't need products worth such a big amount, and you can't punish your customers for that.",-1

this, you send me another one of your pathetic canned response without a 
substantial action. Only god can bless you and your business. When will you

Worst ever service received.. They delivered a defective product worth of Rs. 2000 and when I have asked them to return or replace the product and in return they have given brands contact number (which is a wrong no.) and asked me to contact them and Nykaa just have washed out their hand from it. Advice others to avoid ordering from Nykaa as they are not listening to their customers even after their own fault and felt cheated...,-1

No doubt. Nykaa is the best beauty shopping platform and my favourite among all. But this app is not working in my oneplus 6T. Whenever I try to open the app it keeps on loading. Therefore I use nykaa lite app to order my stuff from nykaa. I wish this issue gets resolves quickly so that i can smoothly use the main nykaa app. I gave one star only bcoz of this reason bcoz it doesn't work in my phone. Other than that it deserves 5 star.,-1

Actually i have been shopping from nykaa since 3 years. But for the first time i chose to pay before delivery. the delivery person delivered it to some ppl i dont even know. i got the product after 8 days and in damaged condition. i raised complaint in nykaa. And to my surprise i found the customer support so irresponsible. they are not solving my issue. when i opt for COD u ppl deliver it to me and also call me before delivery. but just because i paid it prior u ppl have no rrsponsibility.,-1

Had a bitter experience of shopping at Nykaa.Really the worst make up shopping app!!Had ordered a PAC eyebrow shaper in brown shade which appeared quite dark brown on the app but after it got delivered I swatched it on my hand and saw that it was very light and did not match my brow colour.After requesting for a replacement (not a refund)I got a reply stating that I cannot replace used product.I even sent them the image to prove that I have not used the product at all but still they told they cannot do it.It was a pathetic experience for me really! Customers mean nothing to them!Other apps are much better in giving customer service and also have a hassle free refund or replacement policy.,-1

"Nykaa is probably the worst marketplace for purchasing fashion and beauty related cosmetic products. A large number of products are listed on this platform in the name of most popular brands, however, after you purchase those products you must be able to realise that those are totally fake and confiscated. If you buy anything like lipsticks, Kajal, expensive creams etc. from here you compromise with your health for sure. In one way nykaa is selling fake products and in the other way they are not",-1

I have been using Nykaa since many years and also ordered products during lockdown . But since past 3 months the app is constantly telling me that my pincode isn't serviceable. I had enquired about it to the customer care too but they have no specific reason for it . They themselves are confused and not aware about it . This is very disappointing . No other shopping sites are being the way nykaa lately has been .Nykaa had been very cooperating and delivering ncly during lckdwn then why not now.,-1

I had ordered a product on 7th of August. Its 15th of august today and my seller has not even confirmed the order.On the top of that when i thought to cancel the product from my cart and order it from somewhere else i got a notification saying that if i cancel the order i will lose my 400rs coupon.I emailed the grievances officer and got a revert from the team that delievery may take longer than usual with no updation in the order. This is how they treat their customers.Very poor service..,-1

It's very disappointing Nykaa . I have placed one order of Huda beauty lipsticks trendsetter and Strobe set about 20 days ago but it's still not delivered to me. I placed the order twice too thinking this time it will be delivered to me but sadly this time also happened the same thing. I was kept waiting . It was a pathetic experience with Nykaa and I am never going to buy any of your products. And for your kind information I also raised concern about my order and rescheduled the delivery date but it was of no help.,-1

Don't buy anything from nyka. They gonna send you damaged products and their customer service is poorest of all. They're having poor service in all categories whether it's about the product shown in pictures or the customer service- they aren't going to reply you ever no matter how much you try..I had tried through every possible mean but they just don't care and last but not the least they will take so much time to deliver that you'll forget even about your order. Please never ever buy anything from this place.,-1

Since 1and a half month this app is temporarily disabled in my state.

Even when your delivery partner was working my products were not delivered until I complained to your representative at least twice to three times..so I think it's high time you change your delivery partner.,-1

This is very cheap app. Plz guys don't buy anything or any product with nykaa they will sent you a duplicate and very cheap quality product. If you don't like product and you wish to return then they will not give back money to you. Plz guys don't waste your money with nykaa it's a very very froud app. They will not give back your money. Useless app no guarantee that they will refund your money so plz guys don't waste your time and money with nykaa.... Be careful.,-1

It's very horrible. They thinks they are right but in reality they are not. I will strictly  not recommend to anyone. Buy the same product from other sites or local retailer.

Very bad. I bought a nail polish. It was defective. The customer care said that they would refund my money and then when I asked for it the next day blatantly refused. The customer care was really dumb kept on asking the same question. She kept me stuck for hours on the chat and ultimately didn't reply. The indigenous nykaa products are really bad. I ordered a 300rs nail polish which was defected.,-1

"Nykaa I am giving you 1 star just because I can't rate you below that. It's pain to deal with you people if there is complaint w.r.t product we ordered. I think you don't check our complaints/ replacement request. And if get in touch with your customer care, then we have to go through entire process again and this time it will be even more time consuming. If you don't support a proper return policy, then atleast make it clear, don't waste our time. Pathetic",-1

Worst experience at nykaa . They claim to have easy refund policy but that's all fake. I got a defective product (eyepencil) from nykaa(doesn't work properly) worth rs 499 which they refused to refund. Talked to customer agent many times told my issues. Send all the images. Still no response. Wasted my pocket Money. Fraud. Buy at your own risk because if something goes wrong they are not answerable. Edit: this is fake concern please reply to mail l have already sent on support@nykaa,-1

"Nykaa Fashion is app is the least user friendly App. Most of the products on Nykaa has only ""within 7 days return"" policy unlike Myntra or Amazon where same products have ""Within 1 month return"" Policy. Nykaa return pick ups are painful. Three delivery attempts are there for which Shadowfax delivery partner updates wrong status and return delivery either gets delayed or cancelled.They do not have nykaa wallet. I would not prefer this App.There are much better apps like Myntra.",-1

"I'm since 4 weeks today. So far I lost 5,9 kgs, waist 5cm smaller. I pro account, however I'm following nutrition plan, bit (~1400 kcal day, 30% protein, 30%carbs 40%fat). Workouts good. Gave 4 stars, log, I'm using MyFitnessPal paper notebook well. Shows progress nicely. You save fav meals (pro), unlock extra workouts (pro). So overall good, I'm really missing food/workout log (just like others).",2

disappointed..",-1
kindly dont install and use this app. it's a waste of money and time ordering from here. visiting a conventional store or even ordering from Amazon is better. I ordered merchandise from here for the first time and received near to expiry date products. it was a tough task initiating for return pick up and then requesting for refund. there is no customer service associate to speak with whom you can explain your issues. unable to request for return pickup. worst app,-1

Just because you are sending me hundreds of notifications doesn't mean I will buy it. Don't be desperate. I am uninstalling it. Your website is better.",-1
