I barely use the app because I use a wheelchair & the QR codes are usually displayed too high for me to reach up & scan. Also, most are laminated, which reflects light. The reflections make it impossible to scan from a sitting position. Pls don't laminate QR Codes.",3,3.0.1
1/18/2021,Difficult to reinstall after shutdown,4,3.0.1
1/18/2021,Used to be convenient to use before the Bluetooth addition. Now it takes ages to open on my modest phone. No wonder the scan totals are falling. It is no longer convenient to use. Perhaps the developers and the politicians all have the latest iPhone courtesy of the taxpayer.,3,3.0.1

1/17/2021,Just a bit slow to load the scanner and then scan the qr code.,4,3.0.1
1/17/2021,The app works fine unless the page you are scanning is under thick plastic or crumpled. Bluetooth ver kills my battery and sends too many notifications. We leave the house once or twice a week so rather just scan and switched off the Bluetooth. The latest ver takes too long to open and scan. About 10x longer than it used to a few months ago. Maybe all this is why ppl are not using it. Keep it simple and quick.,1,3.0.1

1/17/2021,Very easy to use. Updates have fixed any minor frustrations I had with the app.,5,3.0.1

1/8/2021,It was much easier to scan QR codes before the update. Now it's super slow to open compared to previously and very fussy about getting QR codes lined up perfectly and that there's no glare on the code which is tricky when they are often stuck to the inside of a glass door or window facing out for people to use as they enter.,3,3.0.1

Also now, many Q codes won't scan that used to scan easily. 3 out of 4 times I have to enter the visit manually. Whoever developed this app is a rank ameteur and you obviously got him or her cheap.

1/4/2021,The government claimed this new version wouldn't use battery power but this is a false statement. It uses excessive battery and may be the reason why there are less users. Because they have deleted it! I'm sorely tempted myself.,1,3.0.1

1/3/2021,What does it mean when you get this message &quot;checking exposure keys&quot;?,1,3.0.1
1/3/2021,I had to uninstall this app as it kept doing an update a couple of hours after I'd used it and was using all my data. I wasn't very happy. I will try to reinstall again to see if that makes a difference. But will have to uninstall if it happens again. Otherwise the app is good.,2,3.0.1

12/25/2020,Using this app is easy enough. Howwever when it starts &quot;Checking exposure keys&quot; the only way to stop it is to restart my phone so it doesn't drain my battery unnecessarily.

9/3/2020,"I have had no problems with the app but I have had problems with where the QR posters are put. I entered the Auck Downtown car park today and some genius has put the poster on a automatic glass sliding door to go into the PWC building to get to Quay St, Auck. So when u go to scan the poster the door slides across behind another fixed pice of heavy duty glass and the phone camera can't detect the code.

9/2/2020,"Does what it says it does - but badly. From a UX perspective, why is the home screen the dashboard and not the camera? I spend no time on the app doing anything apart from recording visits. As it stands, it's akin to opening your phone's camera app to be greeted by your image gallery instead. Couple this with having to deal with a toddler, or having your hands full and it quickly turns into a major annoyance. It's no wonder not more people are using it considering how many have downloaded it.",2,1.2.0

8/29/2020,Works well and is quick and easy to use. I can scan the QR code or do a manual entry quickly. The most time-consuming thing is getting the phone out of my handbag and entering my cellphone pin to access the app. My old cellphone was about 8 years old and I had to upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy A11 in order to get the app. The QR app does work very well on this phone. I specifically asked for a cellphone in the Spark shop that would do this and was shown a range of cellphones that would do this reliably. The whole process took about 15 minutes in the Spark shop.

Response comment from MoH is poor and makes no sense, as the only QR codes scanned were for COVID purposes at restaurants/cafes, etc. Isn'tthis an educational issue? Consumers can't change this.

I have tried turning on my phone's flashlight, to help this app read a QR code better. This app will turn the flashlight off again as soon as it has focus.

8/12/2020,This is the wackiest user design ever. An extensive password requirement to protect what- my name? Passwords that randomly dont save- grrr.

8/12/2020,"Too difficult to log in. First up, I don't want a generic reply saying ring or email if I have problems. IT IS YOUR JOB to provide an easy-to-use app if you want people to actually use it. And people using it is a public health matter. When you try and confirm your email on your phone, you have to move to the email app, which then signs you out of the covid app - which means the verification code you've just checked is now out of date.

8/11/2020,After going through the reg process it never sent me the code to validate app. Uninstall. So much for trying to care and be responsible.,1,1.2.0
8/11/2020,Why should I have to have a login for an app that should just store the locations I went to locally. If your going to make a success app make it so it doesn't require a login or uses Google/apple authentication so that there is no difficulty in using it. I consider it a flawed design due to the difficulty of usage and clunkyness of design. This is not a hard thing to accomplish. Possibly next time get the app right before it gets released just as a pointer. Your welcome.,1,1.2.0

8/11/2020,Complained 3 times now. I am now downloading an update as I heard that it maybe needed on national radio. If that is needed why doesn't it say so on the app? Extremely poor considering the importance of it at this time. Also the update is taking for ever to go thru.,1,1.2.0
8/11/2020,Hard to set up. 10 digit password is excessive for an app which will not keep any of my details. Multiple attempts to get number to verify my email. Worst aspect is that I can't see anywhere that I can see a list of my entries or edit my visits.,2,1.2.0
8/11/2020,They tell you to register a visit for manual entry and there's nowhere I can see on the app to click that? So the trick is you have to do an update as soon as you download it to get the manual entry option. Wouldve assumed when you downloaded it you got the latest version?,2,1.2.0

No one is doing it anymore- It's not necessary. &quot; So now I'll look forward to using it. Am so glad it's now mandatory for businesses to display it. ps: How was it that FLORIDA knew we had a problem 15 hours before we citizens were informed here in NZ. I guess social media ??,3,1.2.0

After like 27 attempts to get past all the error messages and the fact it would seem I now need to change my email address... I have given up. Good luck if you download it! Came back after a couple of months and gave up ... again. Why do they give the bureaucrats these jobs? I don't want to have to remember a 10 digit password. Get real.",1,1.2.0
8/11/2020,It doesn't say if it will log my GPS locations. It is unusable without this feature. Who in their right mind and jobs on hand would want to do manual recording or scanning qr code. I want to do the manual scanning only if I choose to switch off the GPS service.,2,1.2.0
8/11/2020,"Does what it says it does. The only thing that annoys me is that after you hit submit, you can't edit the entries made into the diary. This is annoying as mistakes can happen during entering data.",4,1.2.0
8/11/2020,Login process is impossible so pretty pointless! I need to open my email to see the security code and when I return to the app the screen I was previously on has disappeared and it wants me to log in or sign up again. Going in circles....,1,1.2.0

8/11/2020,"Too many requirements. Why do I have to sign-up for an account? Why do you have to store any information about me? Why can't I just use it as a local register on my own phone that I can refer back to as & when needed? It could still download a daily list of 'at risk' QR sites to do a local comparison and warn if any places I'd scanned were on the danger lists. So I jumped through your password rules hoops (why?) then I had to enter a pin sent to my email - only I was signing up on my phone and I don't have email on my phone! So it's not easy to just install and start using offline. They're pretty standard requirements I know but if you want buy-in you need to make it as simple and easy as possible. If people want to volunteer more info, let them. If they don't, you should still let people install and use it offline. There's no reason QR codes and manual entries can't be logged without an email/password logon. Also, the app isn't even available for so many phones.

You need to create a way that when entering manual entries in the &quot;place/location&quot; field it points to a map locator or address, cause the way it is now it's just a text entry and you need FAST tracking in place!

Hey,
Good on you for getting out an app so quickly under such time and privacy constraints, across two device platforms. 

Iâm not personally 100% keen on the email and password data being hosted in Sydney on an AWS server, especially in a govt project, but as youâve gone to the trouble of ensuring other data is both optional and locally kept, itâs an ease of implementation sacrifice Iâll live with.

10/26/2020,"Overall, I have liked the ease of the COVID tracer app. Updates have seen the tracking gone from 30 to 60 days, and more businesses have included the QR codeâs to sign in. Manually being able to enter has also been great. 

One of the things which would be great is to have the diary link to the account rather than the phone. This would help with people who have both a work and personal phone, so that they can see where they were easier rather than looking at both diaries to work it out. 

The second is that while the app is compatible with most phones, I have had no luck in getting a manual or automatic diary entry to work on the iPhone 11. I can see there were issues a few months ago, however, the recommendations to redownload the app and restart the phone have been unsuccessful. This means that two phones need to be carried to sign in, and this is not always feasible.

Resolved the above issue. Donât ask me what I did but after spending about 30 minutes trying to create an account/reset password I gave up. Then had a final crack the next day. A out of nowhere it accepted me email address to create an account. 

But out of no where after working for a while and scanning codes reliably, now it flat out doesnât work. Throws an error every time. Login log out doesnât resolve. For a contact tracing app that the govt is relying on for accurate information for a pandemic and controlling the spread, the nicest thing I can say about it is itâs unreliable.
