The project seeks to investigate people’s motivations for using the NZ COVID Tracer App. 
Understanding people’s experiences and perceptions can help improve the utilisation rate of the app and enabling better contact tracing.
The NZ COVID Tracer App is part of the strategy to manage the COVID19 pandemic in New Zealand.
The app’s design and use have evolved through the different stages of the pandemic, from initial voluntary use to record and trace locations, to the integration of Bluetooth, and now its mandatory use when visiting locations during various alert level settings. 
Despite the high number of app registrations (approximately 3,200,000 downloads as of 15 September 2021), the public’s actual use of the app’s functions does not show equivalence in numbers. 
The number of devices with Bluetooth active, as of 15 September 2021, is only around 2 million.
The highest number of active devices (active means the device is used for QR scanning or manual entry) in a day was only 1,173,000 on 10 September 2021. 
Before 9 September 2021, the number of active devices was less than 1,000,000 a day. These numbers show that downloading an app does not equate to subsequent use; the focus of this project is to investigate the public’s behaviour in downloading and using the app.


The proposed project will enhance the current understanding of user experience with the NZ COVID Tracer App using large data sets to gain insights. 
The proposed project will analyse feedback gained through reviews from the app stores and comments from social media. 
Analysing a large number of self-reports through user reviews and social media posts makes it possible to draw inferences on user experience that may not be replicated through structured surveys.

The project will scrape available data from the Apple and Android App Store. 
Data from the Ministry of Health will also be used to cross-reference patterns of user downloads and use. 
Other potential sources will be scoped and gathered as necessary. Then, Artificial Intelligence based computational analysis supported by 
a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique will analyse the multi-modal data to see trends in user behaviour and highlight frequent challenges users encounter with the NZ COVID Tracer App.  
The data will be analysed across a time series and map out any changes in sentiments when new functionalities are introduced or significant COVID19-related events happen.

The results of this study will provide a more holistic picture of the performance of the NZ COVID Tracer App throughout the two years since the pandemic started. 
The findings will highlight gaps and provide opportunities for future research to enhance the design and use of the NZ COVID Tracer App.
